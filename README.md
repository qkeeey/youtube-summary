# YouTube Channel Summarizer

A **Streamlit** web application designed to help you monitor and stay up-to-date with the latest videos from your favorite YouTube channels. The app retrieves the most recent videos (within a configurable timeframe), extracts their transcripts, and generates concise summaries using ChatGPT. It can also categorize channels by topic and provide audio playback of summaries for hands-free updates.

## Key Features
- **Add YouTube Channels**: Input multiple channel URLs (supports standard channel IDs, custom URLs, user channels, or `@` handles).
- **Automated Summaries**: Fetches transcripts for the latest videos in the past 7 days (configurable) and generates short/detailed summaries.
- **Topic Filtering**: Categorizes each channel into relevant topics with the help of ChatGPT, enabling quick filtering by interest.
- **Audio Playback**: Converts short summaries into audio via Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS), supporting multiple languages.
- **Customizable Summary Styles**: Choose how the summaries are presented (step-by-step, bullet points, story-based, etc.).
- **Data Persistence**: Uses CSV files (`channels.csv` and `videos.csv`) to store channel data, video metadata, and summaries.

## Overview of Implementation
1. **Initialization**:
   - The app checks for two CSV files (`channels.csv` and `videos.csv`) in a `data` folder. If they don't exist, it creates them with the necessary headers.
2. **Channel Processing**:
   - Users enter YouTube channel URLs in the sidebar.
   - The app resolves channel IDs, fetches channel titles and descriptions, and uses ChatGPT to categorize them.
   - Channel info is saved to `channels.csv`.
3. **Video Fetching & Summaries**:
   - For each channel, the YouTube Data API retrieves the latest videos from the last 7 days (default).
   - The YouTube Transcript API attempts to fetch transcripts, which are then cleaned to reduce tokens.
   - ChatGPT generates short and (optionally) detailed summaries in the transcriptâ€™s original language.
   - Summaries, along with transcripts and language codes, are stored in `videos.csv`.
4. **Display & Filtering**:
   - The main interface shows a list of available topics derived from processed channels.
   - Users can filter by topic or view all channels.
   - Each video entry includes the short summary, a button for a more detailed summary, and an option to play the short summary audio.
   - Clicking a button generates the detailed summary on-demand and saves it to `videos.csv`.
5. **Styling Summaries**:
   - Several checkboxes let users request bullet-point, story-based, or step-by-step summaries. ChatGPT dynamically adapts to these preferences.

## Installation & Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/youtube-channel-summarizer.git
    cd youtube-channel-summarizer
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Set Your API Keys**:
   - You will need valid **YouTube Data API** and **OpenAI ChatGPT** credentials.
   - You can store them in `st.secrets`, environment variables, or directly in the code (not recommended for security). 
     - **YOUTUBE_API_KEY**: A valid API key for YouTube Data API.
     - **CHATGPT_API_KEY**: A valid API key for ChatGPT usage.
4. **Run the App**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
   - The application will launch in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501/`.

## Configuration & Customization
- **`YOUTUBE_API_KEY`**: Replace it with your own in the code or set as an environment variable/secret.
- **`CHATGPT_API_KEY`**: Likewise, replace or configure as needed.
- **`CHATGPT_API_URL`**: Points to the ChatGPT deployment endpoint; can be changed if you have a different endpoint or model.
- **CSV Filenames**: By default, `channels.csv` and `videos.csv` are used inside `data/`. You can rename or relocate them, but be sure to update references in the code.
- **Number of Videos Fetched**: Currently set to fetch the **latest 3 videos** from the past 7 days. Adjust in the `get_latest_videos(api_key, channel_id, days=7)` function if needed.
- **Token Optimization**: If you want to tweak how filler words are removed or how transcripts are truncated, you can modify the `remove_stopwords_and_articles()` function.
- **Summary Style**: By default, the app offers checkboxes for step-by-step, story-based, bullet points, etc. Add or remove preferences in the `build_style_instructions()` function.
